# Closures

1. Write a closure that takes a function and then check whether the function passed has a docstring with more than 50 characters. 50 is stored as a free variable
2. Write a closure that gives you the next Fibonacci number
3. We wrote a closure that counts how many times a function was called. Write a new one that can keep a track of how many times add/mul/div functions were called, and update a global dictionary variable with the counts
4. Modify above such that now we can pass in different dictionary variables to update different dictionaries
